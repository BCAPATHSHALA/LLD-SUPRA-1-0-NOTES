## 1. üìù What is A Good Coder / Quality Code?

- A good coder produces quality code that is not only functional but also maintainable, scalable, and robust.
- Quality code adheres to coding standards, is well-documented, and follows best practices.
- It should be easy to understand, modify, and extend without introducing bugs or unexpected behavior.

### A good coder produces quality code that possesses the following characteristics:

1. **`Readable:`** Code is easy to understand and maintain.
2. **`Rememberable Code:`** Comments are used judiciously to explain complex logic or algorithms.
3. **`Extensible:`** Code can be easily extended without major modifications.
4. **`Flexible:`** Code is adaptable to changes in requirements or environment.
5. **`Stable:`** Exception handling is implemented effectively to ensure stability.
6. **`Modular:`** Code is organized into logical modules, promoting reusability and maintainability.
7. **`Secure:`** Security measures are implemented to protect against vulnerabilities and threats.
8. **`Correct:`** Code functions as intended and produces expected outcomes.

## 2. üìù Functional Vs Object Oriented Programming

</p>

Functional Programming (FP) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are two paradigms used in software development.

- **`Functional Programming: (TREE)`** Focuses on the evaluation of expressions, avoiding changing-state and mutable data. Functions are treated as first-class citizens, enabling higher-order functions and immutability.

- **`Object-Oriented Programming: (LEGO)`** Organizes software design around objects, which encapsulate data and behavior. Objects interact with each other through methods and messaging.

Both paradigms have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the project.

## 3. üìù What is SOLID Principles?

The SOLID principles are a set of five fundamental design principles that were introduced by `Robert C. Martin` (Uncle Bob), named by `Michael Feathers`.

### Why SOLID Principles? (Good Coder)

1. To make code more maintainable, easier to understand, easy to use.

2. To make it easier to quickly extend the system with new functionality without breaking the existing ones.

3. To make the code easier to read and understand, thus spend less time figuring out what it does and more time actually developing the solution. (Time Saving)

### The SOLID principles are:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
