## üìù What is OOAD?

**Object-oriented analysis and design** (OOAD) in the process of creating software helps us look at and plan a system using ideas about "objects" - like parts of the software that represent things in the real world. In OOAD, we first check out the whole system we need for a certain issue, then find and name the "objects" in that system. After that, we figure out how these objects are connected and make a plan for the whole system.

## üìù Why OOAD?

The object-oriented analysis and design process is highly well-known. The following are a few reasons why it is quite renowned among the community:

1. It's extremely easy to understand, which helps in creating models of complex problems.
2. Concepts such as inheritance help make the data reusable and scalable.
3. It's easily maintainable, which helps identify the issues in the early processes and saves time.

**`In short,`** Easy to understand and communicate between a technical and non-technical person in an organization about a project.

## üìù Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA)

### Objective:

The goal of analysis is to understand and define the problem domain, identify the system's requirements, and create a conceptual model of the system.

### Activities:

1. **Requirement Gathering:** Gather information about the system's requirements from stakeholders, users, and existing documentation.

2. **Problem Definition:** Clearly define the problem that the system is intended to solve.

3. **Use Case Modeling:** Identify and define use cases, which represent the interactions between the system and external entities (users or other systems).

4. **Identify Objects:** Identify and model the key entities or objects in the problem domain. Objects encapsulate both data and behavior.

5. **Define Relationships:** Establish relationships between objects, representing how they interact and collaborate.

6. **Behavioral Analysis:** Specify the dynamic behavior of the system by defining scenarios and state transitions.

7. **Create Diagrams:** Use tools like Unified Modeling Language (UML) to create diagrams (class diagrams, use case diagrams, etc.) that visually represent the system's structure and behavior.

## üìù Object-Oriented Design (OOD)
### Objective: 
The goal of design is to transform the conceptual model created during analysis into a detailed and implementable plan for the software system.

### Activities:
1. **Architectural Design:** Define the overall architecture of the system, including high-level structures and components.

2. **Detailed Design:** Elaborate on the architecture by specifying the details of each class, defining their attributes, methods, and relationships.

3. **Interface Design:** Design the interfaces (methods and data) that allow objects to interact with each other.

4. **Database Design:** If applicable, design the database schema and define how objects will be persisted.

5. **Concurrency and Security Design:** Address issues related to concurrent execution, data integrity, and system security.

6. **Design Patterns:** Apply design patterns to solve common design problems and promote reusability.

7. **Create Design Diagrams:** Use UML or other design notations to create diagrams that document the detailed design, such as class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and component diagrams.
