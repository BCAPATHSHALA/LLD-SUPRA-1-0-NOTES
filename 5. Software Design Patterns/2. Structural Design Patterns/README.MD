# What are Structural Design Patterns?

Structural design patterns are blueprints that explain **how to combine objects and classes to create larger structures in software engineering**. They help to make structures more efficient and flexible, and allow for specific parts of a structure to be changed without affecting the whole thing.

_In Structural Design Patterns, We can add new features without changing in the existing code._

## Types of Structural Design Patterns?

There are mainly 7 types of structural design patterns:

1. Decoder Design Pattern
2. Adapter Design Pattern
3. Proxy Design Pattern
